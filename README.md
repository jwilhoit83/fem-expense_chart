# Front End Mentor - Expense Chart

Front End Mentor Expense Chart made using CSS and a small amount of JS to populate the daily expenditure data in the tooltips as well as set the heights on the bars for the graph.  The component is fully responsive until you get below 300px then it starts to get a little broken.  Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions and thanks for checking it out!
